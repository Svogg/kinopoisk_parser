# TOP250_Kinopoisk_parser

## This project was made because of technical task from magnit.tech



## There were several problems which i need to done with.
### 1) The first one and maybe most important - to parse data from 5 links of https://www.kinopoisk.ru/lists/series-top250/?page=1&tab=all
### 2) The second problem was to collect parsed data into dictionary data structure.
### 3) Then the last problem was to convert dict into csv file.
### Additionaly i made ipynb sript which can draw bar chart based on a scv file.


# Attention! 

### This script has big disadvantage. It can't deal with yandex capthca. You need to pass capthca 6 times by yourself while the script works. You'll have 17 seconds to pass it right otherwise it will return an error.
